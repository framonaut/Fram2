## Pioneering Vision
Fram2 represents the vanguard of commercial space exploration—humanity's first polar orbit human spaceflight mission, scheduled for launch on March 31, 2025. This unprecedented venture transcends traditional spaceflight paradigms, uniting cutting-edge aerospace technology with Web3 innovation to create an interactive bridge between space exploration and global participation.

## International Mission
Our distinguished international civilian team will embark on a transformative journey aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center's historic Launch Pad 39A. The mission—traversing Earth in a near-perfect polar orbit with 90° inclination every 93 minutes—will conduct revolutionary observations of Earth's polar regions while establishing a new model for public engagement in space endeavors through advanced blockchain technology.

## Elite Crew
* **Chun Wang (China)**: Mission Commander, entrepreneur in space exploration and Web3 sectors
* **Jannicke Mikkelsen (Norway)**: Film director and Vehicle Commander
* **Rabea Rogge (Germany)**: Robotics engineer and radio experiment specialist
* **Eric Philips (Australia)**: Polar explorer and Medical Officer
