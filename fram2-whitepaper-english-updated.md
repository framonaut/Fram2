## The Future of Space Exploration: A Bridge Between Commercial Spaceflight and Polar Orbits

The world is entering a new era driven by commercial spaceflight. Fram2 is the world's first polar orbit human spaceflight mission, uniting an international civilian team scheduled to launch on March 31, 2025, aboard SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39A. This is not merely a technological feat but a fusion of science, education, and community participation. Through Web3 technology, Fram2 opens space exploration to users worldwide, writing a new chapter in spaceflight history.

## 1. Project Overview

**Initial Blockchain**: Solana (issued through the pump.fun platform)  
**Future Blockchain**: Fram2 Chain (high-performance EVM-compatible public chain)  
**Key Partners**:
* **Space Launch Provider**: SpaceX

Fram2 plans to execute the world's first polar orbit human spaceflight, combining polar observations, aerospace medicine, and scientific-educational experiments while utilizing Web3 technology to achieve transparency and community participation. Through fair issuance of $FRAM tokens on Solana via pump.fun, global users are invited to support scientific and educational activities, with future plans to launch Fram2 Chain to promote decentralized management of aerospace data.

## 2. Vision and Mission

**Vision**: To explore polar orbits through commercial spaceflight and Web3 technology, advancing space science and education, breaking down traditional barriers, and promoting diverse participation in building humanity's multi-planetary future.

**Mission**: To combine SpaceX's commercial spaceflight capabilities with Web3 technologies (blockchain, NFTs) to execute polar orbit missions, achieving experimental transparency and global collaboration.

## 3. Project Background and Inspiration

* **Mission Origin**: Fram2 was proposed in 2023 and officially announced by SpaceX in August 2024, marking a new phase of commercial spaceflight expanding into high-inclination orbits, continuing the exploratory spirit of the Norwegian exploration vessel "Fram."

* **SpaceX Partnership**: Fram2 utilizes the Falcon 9 rocket (booster B1085's 6th use), scheduled for launch on March 31, 2025, to validate commercial spacecraft capabilities in polar orbits.

* **Blockchain Strategy**: Fram2 adopts a two-phase plan: initially issuing $FRAM tokens through Solana's pump.fun to establish community support; later launching Fram2 Chain to optimize aerospace data and scientific-educational interaction.

## 10. Founder Background

**Chun Wang (Satofishi)**: As the initiator and Mission Commander of Fram2, Chun Wang has extensive experience in blockchain and Web3 sectors, co-founding F2Pool and Stakefish. His aviation and exploration background is particularly rich, having completed nearly 1,000 flights and visited 135 countries and territories prior to the Fram2 mission. He first presented the Fram2 concept to SpaceX in Miami in May 2023, and after extensive preparation, has finally turned this vision into reality.

Wang holds profound insights about space and the multi-planetary future. He has discussed future Martian political systems, tensions between planetary protection and colonization, and why Mars should not become the next Antarctica with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. In his view, this spaceflight is not only a personal milestone but a key step in supporting humanity's journey to become a multi-planetary species.

His team chose a bear as their zero-gravity indicator, symbolizing the spirit of exploration and courage in the face of the unknown. Wang emphasizes that while this is the Fram2 team's first space mission, spaceflight is becoming increasingly routine with the development of commercial spaceflight—a positive direction in human space exploration.
